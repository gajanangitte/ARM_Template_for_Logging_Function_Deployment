# Deploy a Azure Function for Flow Logs version 3, using an ARM template

The master branch contains a generic version of the deployment template, tailored for a fictional version of a function . The Deploy to Azure button below works, but there's no function to be deployed with current settings.

See other branches for more specific, working examples.
